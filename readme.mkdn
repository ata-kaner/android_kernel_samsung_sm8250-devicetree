## **Device tree sources for Samsung Snapdragon 865 family.**

**Status: Incomplete**

Samsung accidentally leaked these sources with very early Android 11 kernel releases. They are mostly incomplete.
However, they can be recreated by reverse engineering prebuilt dts files provided to kernel release of each Samsung Kona device.
